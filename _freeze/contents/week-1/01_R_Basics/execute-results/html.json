A prompt, the `>` sign, is displayed when R is waiting for an expression.\n\n*Expressions* in R are line(s) of code that perform a particular task; are separated by a semi-colon (`;`) or a new line; can be grouped together using braces (`{` and `}`); are often stored in *functions*.\n\n## Using the R console\n\n\\[Picture of 2 + 2 in the R console\\]\n\n## Using the R console\n\nIf an expression is incomplete at the end of a line, a `+` is displayed on subsequent lines until it is syntactically complete.\n\n\\[Picture of incomplete expression\\]\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhen a complete expression is entered into the R console, it is *evaluated*. The result of the evaluated expression is then *returned*. Depending on the expression, the result might be printed or not. For example, the following expression is evaluated but nothing is printed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1  # Nothing is printed...\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo print the result, we use the `print` function or simply type the name of the object.\n\n## R as a calculator\n\nR is basically a calculator! Most of the usual mathematical functions are already implemented (`+`, `-`, `*`, `sqrt`, `exp`, etc.). You can type `?S4groupGeneric` to see all the default implemented mathematical functions.\n\n## Order of operations\n\nAs for mathematics, the order in which you list operations is important. R uses the BODMAS rule to decide on the ordering of the calculations:\n\n1.  **B**rackets\n2.  **O**rders (powers and roots)\n3.  **D**ivision\n4.  **M**ultiplication\n5.  **A**ddition\n6.  **S**ubtraction\n\nIt is often very useful to use brackets to make the ordering explicit. For example the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n10 + 4 / 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.outputcode}\n[1] 12\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nwill perform the `4 / 2` part first and then add the result to `10`. While if we use brackets:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(10 + 4) / 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.outputcode}\n[1] 7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nthe `10 + 4` part is calculated first and the result is then divided by `2`.\n\n## Assignment operators\n\nIn R, the basic *assignment* operator is `<-`. For example, to store the value $1$ into the variable `x`, type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou could also use `=` as assignment operator, but this is generally reserved for use in function arguments. Rarely, you will come across the assignment operator `<<-`. This operator is used to define variables in *a different environment* than the one you are working in.\n\n## Getting help in R\n\nType the name of the function into the search bar in the Help pan and press Enter. The Help file can be opened from the R console using the command `?function` or `help(function)`.\n\nGoogle is your friend! And so is [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/r-language)...\n\n\\[Picture of the help file of sqrt\\]\n\n## Additional resources\n\n- [R manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html) by the R Core Team.\n\n- [R reference](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) card by Tom Short.\n\n- Assignment operator [`<<-`](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Scope).\n",
